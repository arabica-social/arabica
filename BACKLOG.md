## Description

This file includes the backlog of features and fixes that need to be done.
Each should be addressed one at a time, and the item should be removed after implementation has been finished and verified.

## Features

1. LARGE: complete record styling refactor that changes from table-style to more mobile-friendly style
   - Likely a more "post-style" version that is closer to bsky posts
   - To be done later down the line
   - setting to use legacy table view

2. Settings menu (mostly tbd)
   - Private mode -- don't show in community feed (records are still public via pds api though)
   - Dev mode -- show did, copy did in profiles (remove "logged in as <did>" from home page)
   - Toggle for table view vs future post-style view

## Fixes

- Loading columns for brews table doesn't match loaded column names
